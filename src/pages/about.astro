	<p>
		I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
		on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
	</p>

	<p>
		This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
		back and see how my journey is going!
	</p>
	<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
		<li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
		{
			identity.hobbies.length >= 4 && (
				<li>
					Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]}, {identity.hobbies[1]}, {identity.hobbies[2]},{identity.hobbies[3]}
				</li>
			)
		}
	</ul>
	<p>My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li>{skill}</li>)}
	</ul>
</Layout>
